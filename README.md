# Lab2

In my generated map, I attempted to map the locations of users that were discussing the current volitalile stock market by tracking the stock that is garnering the most attention, GME. The data showed mostly a clustering on the east coast around New York, which could have been predictable given the fact that Wall street is in New York, and it was during trading hours that I collected the data.
